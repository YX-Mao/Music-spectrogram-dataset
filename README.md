# 1. Introduction
The data set contains 9,000 music.  In order to meet the input needs of CNN, 
we converted the audio signal of 9000 pieces of music into spectrograms. 
The data set contains a total of 197,463 spectrograms, 9 categories.

# 2. The category labels are as follows:
$ Breakbeat  
$ Deep House  
$ Disco  
$ Downtempo  
$ Drum and Bass  
$ Dubstep Grime  
$ Electro House  
$ Euro Dance  
$ Trance  

# 3. The file naming format is as follows:
label-song id-spectrogram id
For example: deep_house-792-001, "deep_house" is label, "792" is song id, "001" is spectrogram id.
